<h2>Overview</h2>

Makeflow is a <b>workflow engine</b> for distributed computing.
It accepts a specification of a large amount of work to be
performed, and runs it on remote machines in parallel where possible.
In addition, Makeflow is fault-tolerant, so you can use it to coordinate
very large tasks that may run for days or weeks in the face of failures.
Makeflow is designed to be similar to <b>Make</b>, so if you can write
a Makefile, then you can write a Makeflow.
<p>
You can run a Makeflow on your local machine to test it out.
If you have a multi-core machine, then you can run multiple tasks simultaneously.
If you have a Condor pool or a Sun Grid Engine batch system, then you can send
your jobs there to run.  If you don't already have a batch system, Makeflow comes with a
system called Work Queue that will let you distribute the load across any collection
of machines, large or small.
<p>
Makeflow is part of the <a href=http://www.cse.nd.edu/~ccl/software>Cooperating Computing Tools</a>.  You can download the CCTools from <a href=http://www.cse.nd.edu/~ccl/software/download>this web page</a>, follow the <a href=install.html>installation instructions</a>, and you are ready to go.

<h2>The Makeflow Language</h2>

The Makeflow language is very similar to Make.
A Makeflow script consists of a set of rules.
Each rule specifies a set of <i>target files</i> to create,
a set of <i>source files</i> needed to create them,
and a <i>command</i> that generates the target files from the source files.
<p>
Makeflow attempts to generate all of the target files in a script.
It examines all of the rules and determines which rules must run before
others.  Where possible, it runs commands in parallel to reduce the
execution time.
<p>
Here is a real Makeflow that does something more complex:
it downloads an image from the web, creates four variations
of the image, and then combines them back together into an animation.
The first and the last task are marked as LOCAL to force them to
run on the controlling machine.

Note that Makeflow differs from Make in a few important ways.
Read section 4 below to get all of the details.

<h2>Running Makeflow</h2>

To try out the example above, copy and paste it into a file named <tt>example.makeflow</tt>.
To run it on your local machine:

<pre>
% makeflow example.makeflow
</pre>

Note that if you run it a second time, nothing will happen, because all of the files are built:

<pre>
% makeflow example.makeflow
makeflow: nothing left to do
</pre>

Use the <tt>-c</tt> option to clean everything up before trying it again:

<pre>
% makeflow -c example.makeflow
</pre>

If you have access to a batch system running <a href=http://www.sun.com/software/sge>SGE</a>,
then you can direct Makeflow to run your jobs there:

<pre>
% makeflow -T sge example.makeflow
</pre>

Or, if you have a <a href=http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor>Condor Pool</a>,
then you can direct Makeflow to run your jobs there:

<pre>
% makeflow -T condor example.makeflow
</pre>

To submit Makeflow as a Condor job that submits more Condor jobs:

<pre>
% condor_submit_makeflow example.makeflow
</pre>

You will notice that a workflow can run very slowly if you submit
each batch job to SGE or Condor, because it typically
takes 30 seconds or so to start each batch job running.  To get
around this limitation, we provide the Work Queue system.
This allows Makeflow to function as a master process that 
quickly dispatches work to remote worker processes.
<p>
To begin, let's assume that you are logged into a machine
named <tt>barney.nd.edu</tt>. start your Makeflow like this:
<pre>
% makeflow -T wq example.makeflow
</pre>

Then, submit 10 worker processes to Condor like this:

<pre>
% condor_submit_workers barney.nd.edu 9123 10
Submitting job(s)..........
Logging submit event(s)..........
10 job(s) submitted to cluster 298.
</pre>

Or, submit 10 worker processes to SGE like this:
<pre>
% sge_submit_workers barney.nd.edu 9123 10
</pre>

Or, you can start workers manually on any other machine you can log into:
<pre>
% worker barney.nd.edu 9123
</pre>

Once the workers begin running, Makeflow will dispatch multiple
tasks to each one very quickly.  If a worker should fail, Makeflow
will retry the work elsewhere, so it is safe to submit many
workers to an unreliable system.
<p>
When the Makeflow completes, your workers will still be available,
so you can either run another Makeflow with the same workers,
remove them from the batch system, or wait for them to expire.
If you do nothing for 15 minutes, they will automatically exit.
<p>
Note that <tt>condor_submit_workers</tt> and <tt>sge_submit_workers</tt>
are simple shells scripts, so you can edit them directly if you would
like to change batch options or other details.

<h2>The Fine Details</h2>

The Makeflow language is very similar to Make, but it does have a few important differences that you should be aware of.

<h3>Get the Dependencies Right</h3>

You must be careful to accurately specify <b>all of the files that a rule requires and creates</b>, including any custom executables.  This is because Makeflow uses this information to construct the environment for a remote job.  For example, suppose that you have written a simulation program called <tt>mysim.exe</tt> that reads <tt>calib.data</tt> and then produces and output file.  The following rule won't work, because it doesn't inform Makeflow what files are neded to execute the simulation:
<pre>
# This is an incorrect rule.

output.txt:
        ./mysim.exe -c calib.data -o output.txt
</pre>

However, the following is correct, because the rule states all of the files needed to run the simulation.  Makeflow will use this information to
construct a batch job that consists of <tt>mysim.exe</tt> and <tt>calib.data</tt> and uses it to produce <tt>output.txt</tt>:

<pre>
# This is a correct rule.

output.txt: mysim.exe calib.data
        ./mysim.exe -c calib.data -o output.txt
</pre>

<h3>No Phony Rules</h3>

For a similar reason, you cannot have "phony" rules that don't actually
create the specified files.  For example, it is common practice to define
a <tt>clean</tt> rule in Make that deletes all derived files.  This doesn't
make sense in Makeflow, because such a rule does not actually create 
a file named <tt>clean</tt>.  Instead use the <tt>-c</tt> option as shown above.

<h3>Just Plain Rules</h3>

Makeflow does not support all of the syntax that you find in various versions of Make.  Each rule must have exactly one command to execute.  If you have multiple commands, simply join them together with semicolons.  Makeflow allows you to define and use variables, but it does not support  pattern rules, wildcards, or special variables like <tt>$&lt;</tt> or <tt>$@</tt>.  You simply have to write out the rules longhand, or write a script in your favorite language to generate a large Makeflow.

<h3>Local Job Execution</h3>

Certain jobs don't make much sense to distribute.  For example, if you have a very fast running job that consumes a large amount of data, then it should simply run on the same machine as Makeflow.  To force this, simply add the word <tt>LOCAL</tt> to the beginning of the command line in the rule.

<h3>Batch Job Refinement</h3>

When executing jobs, Makeflow simply uses the default settings in your batch system.  If you need to pass additional options, use the <tt>BATCH_OPTIONS</tt> variable or the <tt>-B</tt> option to Makeflow.  If you are using Condor, this string will be added to each submit file.  For example, if you want to add <tt>Requirements</tt> and <tt>Rank</tt> lines to your Condor submit files, add this to your Makeflow:
<pre>
BATCH_OPTIONS=Requirements = (Memory>1024)\nRank = Mips
</pre>

<h3>Displaying a Makeflow</h3>

When run with the <tt>-D</tt> option, Makeflow will emit a diagram of the Makeflow in the
<a href=http://www.graphviz.org>Graphviz DOT</a> format.  If you have <tt>dot</tt> installed,
then you can generate an image of your workload like this:

<pre>
% makeflow -D example.makeflow | dot -T gif > example.gif
</pre>

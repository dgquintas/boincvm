/** @file work_queue.h A master-worker library.
 The work queue provides an implementation of the master-worker computing
model using TCP sockets, Unix applications, and files as intermediate buffers.
A master process uses @ref work_queue_create to create a queue, then
@ref work_queue_submit to submit tasks.  Once tasks are running, call
@ref work_queue_wait to wait for completion.  The generic <tt>worker</tt>
program can be run on any machine, and simply needs to be told the host
and port of the master.
